## Installing custom fonts

The easiest way to install custom fonts to your RN project is do as follows:

  `1.` Define path to assets directory with fonts in project:

  <i>Example:</i>

  ```js
    module.exports = {
      ...
      assets: [
        './assets/fonts'
      ],
  ```

  <i>Note:</i> `fonts` is a folder with `.ttf` files

  `2.` Place your font files in your assets directory.

  `3.` Link font files, using the following command in the terminal:

  * React Native  `>= 0.69`:

  ```sh
  npx react-native-asset
  ```

  * React Native `< 0.69`:

  ```sh
  npx react-native link
  ```


  `4.` Restart your project to refresh changes.

Now, you are able to use `fontFamily` from font files.
